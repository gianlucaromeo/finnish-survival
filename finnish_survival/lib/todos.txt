Logic
- Refresh page on the web doesn't keep track of the current page
✅ Fix: when the user goes back to the previous word, the translation is not shown

UI/UX
✅ Make items fully clickable
✅ Change status indicator to avoid confusion on the current state
✅ Make title of topics scrollable with slivers
✅ Fix: safe area, color of the app bar
- Explain how learn works - people get confused
- Add different solutions for the same question (like "mä", "minä")
- Re-trigger error when user makes mistakes twice
- Add a way to skip a question
✅ Add trim to the answer
✅ Add a way to see the correct answer
✅ Add a way to get hints
- Add nice "End of the game" screen
- Add something related to favorites
- Add animations
- Fix images size (they are different)
- Add different behaviors on Android and iOS
